## Goals

Although some professors release all of their course schedules at the start of
the semester, some professors release their course schedule in chunks throughout
the semester. If a user used Cotion multiple times throughout the semester, I
wanted Cotion to only add new assignments. For any existing assignments in the
database, Cotion would check to see if there was a change in due date, and
update as necessary.

## Future Features

In Notion, I find myself categorizing my assignments by type (ie. HW, Tests,
Quizzes, etc.) once I have uploaded the Canvas Assignments to Notion. I want the
ability to assign a preliminary assignment category for each assignment
automatically while using Cotion.
